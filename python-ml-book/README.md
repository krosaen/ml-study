# Working my way through the python ML book

[Python Machine Learning](https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book) is an excellent book and all of its code and samples are generously made available by the author; its repo is likely where you want to look.

I nonetheless find benefit in working through the examples and problems myself and occasionally have a different approach than the author. My work and notebooks are here.
